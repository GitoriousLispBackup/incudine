  - vbap ?
  - chaos ugens, gendy, ...
  - utility for fft generator
  - more analysis: lpc, wavelet, ...
  - perhaps flanger, phaser and chorus
  - friction
  - scanned synthesis

* GEN routines

  - envelope generator + (SETF (BUFFER-DATA BUF) ENV)
  - bessel functions
  - Chebyshev polynomials
  - more window functions
  - values from a text file
  - GEN30, GEN40, GEN51 from Csound

* Voicer

  - global and local polyphony
