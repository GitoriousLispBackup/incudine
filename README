Incudine - Music/DSP programming environment for Common Lisp

The original motivation for Incudine was to use only the Common Lisp
language to synthesize high quality sounds controllable at the sample
level, defining and redefining the dsp code on-the-fly without the
necessity to use unit generators pre-built in another language.
