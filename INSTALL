Installation Instructions
*************************

    cd /path/to/your/registry/
    ln -s /path/where/you/put/incudine/incudine.asd
    cd /path/where/you/put/incudine

Edit and copy the configuration file, with particular attention to the
priorities *RT-PRIORITY*, *NRT-PRIORITY* and *RECEIVER-DEFAULT-PRIORITY*

    cp incudinerc-example $HOME/.incudinerc

Compile the C utilities:

    cd src && make

The check for the libraries fails if the pkg-config tool is not
installed on your system. In this case, you can use

    make HAVE_JACK=1 HAVE_PA=1 HAVE_X11=1

replacing 1 with 0 if a library is absent.

If you want to build and install the incudine command:

    make install

The command is installed in /usr/local/bin by default, but you can
change the location by setting the variables PREFIX and/or BINDIR.

If you have Lilv, a LV2 host library, and you want use LV2 plugins in
your scripts:

    rm -f incudine
    make HAVE_LV2=1 install

The variables DYNAMIC_SPACE_SIZE and CONTROL_STACK_SIZE are useful to
set respectively the runtime options --dynamic-space-size and
--control-stack-size of SBCL (all the arguments of the incudine
command are passed to the toplevel).

If you use SLIME, add these lines to $HOME/.swank.lisp

;; Avoid problems in realtime because the default value is :SPAWN (each
;; request in a separate thread)
#+sbcl (setf swank:*communication-style* :sigio)
;; Useful to redirect standard output from any other threads into the REPL
#+sbcl (defparameter swank:*globally-redirect-io* t)

There is also a major mode for GNU Emacs. If you want to install it,
add the following lines to your .emacs file:

(push "/path/to/incudine/contrib/editors/emacs" load-path)
(require 'incudine)
